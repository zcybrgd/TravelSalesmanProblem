# TravelSalesmanProblem
 This is an implementation of the famous traveler salesman problem (implementing the brut force and the heuristic method and comparing between them in terms of the resulting path and execution time)


Implemented Algorithms:

1. The Held–Karp algorithm, is a dynamic programming algorithm proposed in 1962 to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP), in which the input is a distance matrix between a set of cities, and the goal is to find a minimum-length tour that visits each city exactly once before returning to the starting point. It finds the exact solution to this problem, and to several related problems including the Hamiltonian cycle problem, in exponential time.

Purpose: Solve the TSP using Dynamic Programming and memoization.
Bitmasking is used to track visited cities efficiently.
Memoization optimizes the recursion by caching results.
Held-Karp Algorithm is a well-known DP approach for solving TSP in O(n^2⋅2^n) time.
